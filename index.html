            <p id="start">I am a young and enthusiastic developer that is studying IT apllication development at Benedict.</p>
            <p>This is my portfolio website here you'll see some of my projects and what i am working on, this is still a work in progress so stay updated for more news!</p>
            <p>I might need to talk more about me. I am 18 and I have always wanted to do coding and be creative in my own way. As you can see with this website here, I love drawing and making art, and combining that with some cool but simple code :D</p>
            <p>I am currently working on a music streaming app. That will function simulary to your ordinary spotify or Youtube Music streaming services, but these just have their own twist more about that later</p>

I had noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little, with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever; appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances. All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only way he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease; preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship; always equal to himself.</p>

Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy; though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that.</p>
